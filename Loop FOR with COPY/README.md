# "Copy" with "FOR" loop

<b>Things to keep in mind:</b>
* In the file data.txt write the name of the equipment.
* Go through the txt adding the data to the %%a variable.
* Replace [Source Path] with the directory and file name (with its extension) to be copied.
* Replace the [Destination Path] by the destination directory of the data to be copied, leaving for example: \\%%a\c$\DATA
